# CalliopeLinuxSetup
Bits and pieces to make Calliope work with Linux

Calliope is a micro controller used in school settings in Germany. Programming is done mostly in block languages 
in web based editors. These generate Hex code, which first needs to be downloaded to a local device and then has 
to be transfered via USB to the Calliope. For details see https://calliope.cc/ .

Collected here are some bits and pieces to create a setup for this that streamlines this process for Linux.
